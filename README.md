# What?

Your next-level modular web framework. Headless support coming soon.

Built on top of Flask, it offers most Django features, sometimes a tidbit more with far more flexibility.


# Have a go!

```
python3.9 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install shopyo==4.4.3

mkdir blog
cd blog
shopyo new -m # add default modules
shopyo run
```

If errors do (linux, use `set <VAR>` for Windows):

```
export SHOPYO_CONFIG_PROFILE=development
export FLASK_ENV=development
export FLASK_APP=app.py
```

`SHOPYO_CONFIG_PROFILE` is what is defined as keys of `app_config` in `config.py`

It is recommended to use a venv in root folder.

`python -m venv venv`

If for dev install dev_requirements.txt also.

`python -m pip install -r requirements/dev.txt`

go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/dashboard with credentials admin@domain.com / pass

# Big??

Powered by apps / modules. Add as many as you like.

Apps are not enough, organise them in boxes and get the ultimate order you need.

You need a customised Django? This is the project. You need to build an ERP? This is the project.

# Linux??

Hackable to the core. Even the dashboard is but a module.

Don't need our modules? Nuke them. Look boring? modify them

# Reliable?

We don't maintain middlewares. We rely on battle tested batteries like:

- flask_sqlalchemy
- flask_login & co

Heck remove them if you don't want. Want to use Peewee? You can.

# Rich Flask API

Common flask patterns are integrated, the structure is over the moon.

Common flask tasks are provided with an API: custom notifications, bulk form errors

# Back office feel & Theme

All looks are 100% customisable with themes ~ Backend, bootstrap included by default.

Again blow it up & use what you want. It's possible

# Transparent: Code your own web distro

Everything is clear, not hidden. You can 100% customise whatever you want.

We did not hardcode our choices. Our APIS are incremental. You can always use barebones.

# Plug & Play

The modules are put by copy paste. No blueprint codes to write.

# Contribute

We follow a 100% first-timers friendly policy.
